/**
 * Shuffle Club — a standalone landing page for one action: getting an email
 * address onto the newsletter list. Same reasoning as /waitlist: this is the
 * link for a bio, a post, or the foot of an edition, where the homepage would
 * bury the signup under three other sections.
 *
 * Coaching still isn't sold here. The page carries the site nav (from the root
 * layout) but no coaching CTA of its own, and the footer stays one line rather
 * than the full ClubFooter — the newsletter is free, so a €200/mo offer at the
 * foot of it would only interrupt.
 *
 * The form posts `utm_medium: newsletter`, the same value as the homepage
 * block, so both entry points land on one beehiiv segment; the two are told
 * apart by `data-cta-location` and in Vercel Analytics by route.
