/**
 * Privacy policy.
 *
 * Written to describe what the site and the coaching actually do, not from a
 * generator — every processor named below is one this codebase really talks to
 * (beehiiv in `app/api/subscribe/route.ts`, Meta in `components/MetaPixel.tsx`,
 * the Ultra Endurant App's booking page in `components/BookingModal.tsx` and
 * its chat widget in `app/layout.tsx`, Notion in `app/athlete-intake`,
 * YouTube in `components/videos/VideoEmbed.tsx`, Vercel as the host). If a
 * vendor is added or dropped, §5 and §6 change with it.
 *
 * §4 says outright that there is no cookie banner. That is deliberate: it is
 * the true description of what happens on arrival, and a policy that implied
 * otherwise would be worse than one that doesn't mention it. Adding a banner
 * that gates the pixel is the open item — see PROJECT_UPDATES.md.
 *
 * The wording is mirrored in `COPY.md` §16.
