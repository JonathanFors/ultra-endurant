# Site copy — homepage, 404, video library, legal pages

Every word on the page, in the order it appears. **Edit this file freely** — change
the text in the right-hand column / quoted blocks, then tell me and I'll apply it to
the code.

Sections 0–11 are the homepage at `ultraendurant.com`, plus the footer and the
booking popup that appear on every page. Section 12 is the 404 page, shown for any
URL that doesn't exist. Both are live. Section 13 is the training video library at
`/videos` — built, but not published: nothing is filmed yet, so it's hidden from
search. Section 14 is the group-coaching waitlist landing page at `/waitlist` and
section 15 is the Shuffle Club landing page at `/newsletter`; both are live.
Sections 16 and 17 are the two legal pages, `/privacy` and `/terms`, linked from
the footer of every page.

⚠️ **The business was renamed to Ultra Endurant in September 2026.** Two names
appear in this file on purpose and are not interchangeable: **Ultra Endurant** is
the business — tab titles, the logo, the copyright line, the trading name on the
legal pages. **Jonathan Fors** is the person — photo descriptions, the bylines on
`/waitlist` and `/newsletter`, and anywhere the copy is about who an athlete
actually works with. Swapping one for the other changes the meaning.

⚠️ **Sections 16 and 17 are generated from the live pages**, not typed. Edit the
wording in them as freely as anywhere else — but the headings and the `#anchor`
names are structural, so leave those alone.

**Rewritten 23 Aug 2026** against one brief: human over sales, honesty over cool
claims, lead with facts, then go deeper with the feeling underneath them. What that
changed in practice is listed at the bottom under *What the rewrite changed*.

**How to read this**
- `▸ Field` — a label naming the slot, so we both know which bit we mean.
- Text in **bold** inside a line is set in the red "tape" or red highlight.
- 🔒 = a fact that also lives in `CONTEXT.md`. Change it here and it changes there too.
- Lengths matter where noted — some lines can't wrap without breaking the layout.

| Browser tab title | Ultra Endurant — Ultramarathon Coaching with Jonathan Fors |
| Meta description | UESCA-certified ultra-endurance running coach. Remote 1:1 and small-group coaching that builds training around your life — from a first ultra to a hundred-miler. Free 30-minute intro call. |

| Booking link | meet.jonathanfors.com/discovery |

### Navigation bar

The same bar on every page now — homepage, /waitlist, /newsletter, the video
library, the intake form and 404. Links 1–3 are homepage sections and jump home
from anywhere; links 4–5 are the two standalone pages, and whichever one you're
on is shown in red.

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Logo, line 1 | ULTRA ENDURANT |
| Logo, line 2 | COACHING BY JONATHAN FORS |
| Logo alt text | Ultra Endurant — ultramarathon coaching with Jonathan Fors |
| Link 1 | Approach |
| Link 2 | How it works |
| Link 3 | Coaching |
| Link 4 | Group waitlist |
| Link 5 | Newsletter |
| Button (red) | Book a call |

Every booking button on the page now says what it actually is — free, and a
conversation rather than a purchase. The nav one stays short because the bar is
tight at small widths; the fuller "Book a free intro call" is used wherever
there's room.

Link 4 is "Group waitlist" rather than "Group coaching" so it can't be misread
as a second coaching offer sitting next to link 3 — it names the action. The
footer has room for the full "Group coaching waitlist".

### Chat widget

A round launcher pinned to the bottom-right corner of every page. It opens the
Ultra Endurant App's chat panel in an iframe from `app.ultraendurant.com`.

**None of this copy lives in the repo.** The widget is loaded from the app
(`chat-widget.js`, keyed by a token in `app/layout.tsx`) and draws its own
button and panel; the launcher's only text is a 💬 glyph and the aria-labels
"Open chat" / "Close chat". Everything inside the panel — greeting, prompts,
replies — is configured in the app, so changing it means changing it there,
not here.

Replaced the sticky WhatsApp card on 9 September 2026. That card said "WhatsApp
me / I usually reply in a few minutes" and opened a `wa.me` thread to the same
number 1:1 athletes text; it is gone, along with the response-time promise that
ran ahead of §15 of the terms. WhatsApp is still a coaching channel everywhere
it is described as one — it is just no longer the front door on the site.

⚠️ On /waitlist the launcher overlaps that page's sticky bottom bar. The old
card listened for the bar's height and lifted clear; the widget positions
itself and doesn't.

## 1 · Hero

Centred now, and with no photo — the portrait that used to sit beside the headline
is gone. What replaced it is the three key blocks below, which answer "what is this
coaching like" instead of "what does he look like".

> ▸ **Eyebrow**
> Ultra-endurance running coach · UESCA-certified

> ▸ **Headline** — two lines at two sizes. Line 2 sits on the red tape and **cannot wrap**, so keep it under ~16 characters.
> Go the distance
> **1:1 & group coaching**

> ▸ **Body**
> While most coaches focus on the details and lose track of the bigger picture – we do the opposite. Your life, work, family, and other obligations come first as we create a long-lasting training philosophy together.

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Button 1 (red) | Start 1:1 coaching → opens the booking popup |
| Button 2 (outline) | Join group coaching → goes to /waitlist |

### The three keys (at the foot of the hero)

These replaced the old stat rail (UESCA / 744 km / 1:1). The figures didn't
disappear — they're in the record band, section 5, where there's room to say what
they mean.

| ▸ Title | ▸ Body |
| --- | --- |
| Science-backed coaching | Your coach is UESCA-certified with years behind him, and he doesn't only go on what worked for him — the practice is grounded in the research. |
| Holistic approach | You're a whole person with a life to live. Family, work, illness and time off are counted from day one, not treated as things that got in the way. |
| 24/7 messaging & calls | You get Jonathan's number. Message your coach when something comes up, rather than saving it for a weekly slot. |

### Red scrolling ticker

Six items, repeated. Keep them short — they scroll past.

1. 1:1 Ultra Coaching
2. UESCA Certified
3. First Ultra to 100 Miles
4. Holistic Health First
5. 744 km Across Portugal 🔒
6. Remote — Worldwide

---

## 2 · Section 01 — Who you'd work with

The introduction, in Jonathan's own voice, once and at length. This replaced the
old two-panel "The approach" section: the holistic-health argument is now a hero
key and a paragraph here, and the "who this is for" list grew into its own section.
What's left is the part that only works as one person talking.

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Section number | 01 |
| Section label | Who you'd work with |

> ▸ **Headline** — the tape sits on "plan." and cannot wrap.
> You're a person, not a **plan.**

> ▸ **Paragraph 1** (the opening clause is bold on the page)
> **Ultra Endurant is run by me, Jonathan Fors** — a UESCA-certified coach with years of lived experience behind the certificate. There are plenty of coaches out there. Few of them see a person as a whole person with a life to live.

> ▸ **Paragraph 2**
> Most plans start with the schedule and expect your life to bend around it. I start at the other end. Your work, your family, the worries you're already carrying — all of it changes how your body handles training, so all of it gets counted before a single session is written. Rest, and everything else off the road, is part of the work rather than a gap in it.

> ▸ **Paragraph 3** 🔒
> I know what the other way costs. I've run 744 km down the coast of Portugal, and I've stopped at 480 km on the same route two years earlier because my body had had enough of being overruled. The second one is the line on the page. The first one is the reason any of this is worth listening to.

> ▸ **Paragraph 4** (first sentence bold)
> **A week you can repeat is worth more than a perfect week you manage once.** That's the whole method. Everything else is detail.

## 3 · Section 02 — The app

New section. Every athlete works through the Ultra Endurant App, 1:1 and group
alike, so it sits before the prices rather than inside one of them.

⚠️ There is deliberately **no screenshot and no launch date** here — nothing about
the app's build has been decided, so this describes only what it does for an
athlete.

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Section number | 02 |
| Section label | The app |

> ▸ **Headline**
> Everything in **one place.**

> ▸ **Body**
> Every athlete I coach works through the Ultra Endurant App. It's where the plan lives, where we talk, and where everything we've already said stays findable.

### Feature cards

| ▸ Title | ▸ Body |
| --- | --- |
| Your schedule | Every session, in order, with the week laid out — so what's next is never a question. |
| Workout analysis | Finished sessions get read back to you: what the numbers did, and what changed since last time. |
| Calls, live | Weekly video calls happen in the app. Nothing to install, no link to lose. |
| Everything said, kept | Notes and transcripts from every call and WhatsApp thread, searchable. You never have to remember what we agreed. |
| Your links, together | Plans, races, forms, whatever the week needs — in one place instead of five. |

### The AI callout (solid red block)

The one claim on the page that's an argument rather than a feature, which is why
it gets its own block instead of becoming a sixth card.

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Label | Where the AI stops |

> ▸ **Heading**
> The AI doesn't give advice. That's deliberate.

> ▸ **Body**
> It reads your completed sessions and tells you what happened in them. It will not tell you to push, to back off, to run through something, or to change your plan — that's my job, and I think handing health advice to a model is genuinely dangerous. The analysis is a mirror, not a coach.

---

## 4 · Section 03 — Who this is for

New section, grown out of the three-line list that used to sit under the approach.
Four boxes for who it's for (black, red marks) and three for who it isn't (muted,
outlined). The negative column is deliberately the quieter one — turning people
away only works if it doesn't read as a boast.

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Section number | 03 |
| Section label | Who this is for |

> ▸ **Headline** — the tape sits on "early." and cannot wrap.
> I'd rather say no **early.**

> ▸ **Body**
> Coaching only works when the fit is right, and a bad fit wastes your money and my time. So here it is both ways round, before you book anything.

### This is for you if

| ▸ Title | ▸ Body |
| --- | --- |
| You're going long | A first ultra, or a next hundred-miler. Either end of that range is fine — the distance you're chasing matters less than that you're actually chasing one. |
| You have a life already | A job, people who depend on you, and nowhere near enough hours. That's the normal case here, not the awkward one. |
| You've watched a plan fall apart | Month two, usually. You don't need more discipline — you need a plan built for the week you actually get. |
| You want a coach who asks | About your sleep, your stress, the thing at work that's eating you. If that sounds like too much, we're not going to get on. |

### This isn't for you if

| ▸ Title | ▸ Body |
| --- | --- |
| You want a plan file and silence | If what you want is a PDF and no conversation, I'm the wrong coach and an expensive way to get one. There are cheaper places. |
| You want the fastest route, whatever it costs | If the answer to every setback is push harder, we'll spend the whole time arguing. I'll ask you to back off, and I'll mean it. |
| You want someone to just tell you what to do | This works when you say what's actually going on. If you'd rather not be asked, the plan can't respond to anything. |

> ▸ **Closing line under the "isn't" column** ("book the call" is a link that opens the booking popup)
> If you read that list and recognised yourself, no hard feelings — genuinely. And if you're not sure which column you're in, **book the call** and I'll tell you straight.

## 5 · Section 04 — The program

Unchanged from the previous version of the page apart from its number (was 02).

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Section number | 04 |
| Section label | The program |

> ▸ **Headline**
> The plan will change, because **your week does.**

### The four steps

| ▸ No. | ▸ Title | ▸ Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | The intro call | Thirty minutes, free. You tell me where you are and what you're aiming at; I tell you whether I think I can help. |
| 02 | Your full picture | A short intake about your running history, your work, your sleep and who depends on you — not just your splits. |
| 03 | A plan that fits | Training mapped onto the week you actually have, with the load and the rest balanced for you rather than for an average runner. |
| 04 | Every week after | We talk weekly. When work, travel or a bad run of sleep changes what's possible, the plan changes with it. That's normal, not failure. |

### Red callout at the foot of the section

> ▸ **Heading**
> There's no pitch at the end of the call.

> ▸ **Body**
> Thirty minutes, free, and you leave with my honest read on where you are and what your race actually needs. If I'm not the right coach for it, I'll tell you on the call.

## 6 · The record band (photo, full width)

Reframed from the old Portugal band. Portugal is still here and still ends on the
failed attempt — but it's now the last of three credentials rather than the whole
case, so the section answers "is he any good" before the prices arrive.

⚠️ **The ITRA and MDS claims have no source on file.** They're the strongest and
most checkable statements on the site, and neither links to a profile or a result
page. Worth fixing. The MDS line also uses your own phrasing, "placed among the
elites", which could mean *finished among them* or *raced alongside them* —
confirm the actual placing before making it more specific.

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Eyebrow | The record |

> ▸ **Headline**
> I ask you to do it because **I've done it.**

### Record plates

| ▸ Figure | ▸ Label |
| --- | --- |
| Top 5% | Ranked worldwide on ITRA |
| MDS | Placed among the elites, Legendary |
| 744 km 🔒 | Longest run — Portugal's coast |

### Project Portugal, underneath

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Eyebrow 🔒 | Project Portugal · 1–10 August 2026 |

> ▸ **Paragraph 1** 🔒 (every number here is a real fact)
> The entire coastline of Portugal, in 10 days, for men's mental health, with Niki driving support. It was the second attempt. Two years earlier we set out on the same route and my immune system gave out at 480 km.

> ▸ **Paragraph 2**
> The second one is the line on the page. The first one is the reason it's worth anything: I know what it is to do the work, do it properly, and still have to stop — and then to decide whether you go back.

## 7 · Section 05 — Ways to work with me

**Redesigned, and the two offers have swapped places.** Group used to be the big
black block with 1:1 as a slim bar underneath. That showed a waitlist first to
someone ready to start today, so 1:1 now takes the black block and the size, and
group sits beside it as the smaller outlined card.

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Section number | 05 |
| Section label | Ways to work with me |

> ▸ **Headline** — the tape sits on "together." and cannot wrap.

## 8 · Section 06 — The free newsletter

**Redesigned to read as an email newsletter.** The old version opened on a 320px
Shuffle Club lockup and the line "Three editions a week", which reads as a
magazine or a club before it reads as email. The word *newsletter* is now in the
label, the logo is byline-sized, and the subscriber count is on the page.

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Section number | 06 |
| Section label | The free newsletter |
| Beside the logo | An email newsletter |
| Subscriber count 🔒 | 250+ · Runners already reading |

> ▸ **Headline**
> Three emails a week. **Free forever.**

> ▸ **Body**
> One subject a week, from three sides: what the research actually says, what I think about it after running on it, and whatever you send back. It lands in your inbox — no fee, nothing to buy at the end of it, and one click to leave.

🔒 **The subscriber number is real and rounded down.** beehiiv reported 266 active
subscribers on 8 September 2026; the page says 250 so ordinary churn can't make it
false. Re-check beehiiv before raising it, and don't round up.

### The week

The calendar itself is now the **Ultra Endurant App's own booking page**

light, which is why the popup's sheet is black now instead of cream.

The big outlined **404** is the section-index numeral treatment from the homepage,
scaled up — it's decorative and hidden from screen readers, so the "Page not found"
eyebrow is what actually gets read out.

The page now carries the site nav, which is what its own wordmark bar and
"Error 404" label used to stand in for — the nav's section links are absolute,
so they lead home rather than landing on nothing. Still no newsletter signup: a
dead end is the wrong place to ask for an email.

---

## 13 · Video library (`/videos`)

A separate page holding the training videos, plus one page per movement at
`/videos/<slug>` — that per-movement URL is what you send an athlete. Not linked
from the homepage or the nav; like the athlete intake form, you share the link
yourself.

**One clip per movement, not per session.** These are the individual exercises a
plan names, so an athlete can see one done properly before doing it.

**Nothing is filmed yet.** All 21 movements below are your real list, but every
card is empty and the whole page is hidden from search until they exist. That
lifts itself once each entry has a video — nothing to remember to switch off.

**The blurbs are my first draft, not your words.** Each one guesses at what the
clip will cover (setup, common errors, regressions). Reword freely — that's what
this file is for.

### The page itself

The warning shown while the library is unfilmed:

> ▸ **Notice** — disappears on its own once every entry has a video.
> **Not filmed yet.** The 21 movements below are the list — none of them are filmed yet, so every card is still empty. This page stays hidden from search until they are.

### The four categories

Split by what a movement is *for*, not by body part — body parts are handled by
tags instead, so searching "glutes" or "hips" crosses all four.

Strength (11) · Core & trunk (3) · Mobility (3) · Stretches (4)

### The 21 movements

Titles use the most widely recognised name; where I changed what you wrote, the
reason is in the last column. Anything you'd search instead is kept as a tag, so
the old name still finds it.

| ▸ Category | Title | Blurb | Kit | ▸ Renamed from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Strength | Squat | The pattern most of the rest is built on. Foot position, depth, and keeping the weight through the whole foot. | Dumbbell, kettlebell or band (optional) | — |
| Strength | Bulgarian split squat | Back foot raised, one leg doing the work. Setup, how far forward to stand, and the torso position that keeps it honest. | A bench, chair or step; dumbbells optional | — |
| Strength | ATG split squat | The long-stride, full-depth split squat. How far to reach the front foot, how low to go, and where to start if the range isn't there yet. | — | — |
| Strength | Forward walking lunge | Stepping through the lunge rather than returning to the start. Stride length, where the front knee tracks, and staying tall between steps. | Dumbbells (optional) | "forward walking lounges" — typo |
| Strength | Reverse walking lunge | The same walk, stepping backwards. Where the load shifts compared with the forward version, and why the step back takes more control. | Dumbbells (optional) | "backward walking lounges" — "reverse lunge" is the standard term |
| Strength | Glute bridge | Both feet down, hips to full extension. Foot placement, and what to change if you feel it in your hamstrings or your lower back instead. | Resistance band (optional, above the knees) | — |
| Strength | Single-leg glute bridge | The same movement on one leg. Keeping the hips level and the ribs down instead of arching to get higher. | Resistance band (optional) | — |
| Strength | Banded lateral walk | Sideways steps against a band. Where to put the band, how low to stay, and keeping the steps deliberate rather than bouncing along. | Resistance band | — |
| Strength | Single-leg Romanian deadlift | Hinging on one leg. Hips square, spine long, and how to stop it turning into a balance test instead of a hamstring exercise. | Dumbbell or kettlebell (optional) | capitalised "Romanian" |
| Strength | Single-leg calf raise | One leg, through the whole range at both ends. Where most people quietly cut it short, and how to load it once bodyweight is easy. | A step or kerb (optional) | hyphenated "single-leg" |
| Strength | Single-leg hip flexor hold | One leg held up under tension from the hip flexor. Position, height, and how long to hold it for. | Resistance band (optional) | ⚠️ kept your name — see below |
| Core & trunk | Side plank | Stacked, straight, and held. Elbow position, hip height, and what to drop back to when it starts to sag. | — | — |
| Core & trunk | Copenhagen plank raise | Side plank with the top leg supported and the bottom leg lifting to meet it. The easier versions to build from first. | A bench, chair or sofa | dropped "side" — "Copenhagen plank" is the common form |
| Core & trunk | Bird-dog | Opposite arm and leg from all fours, without the hips rolling. Slower and through less range than most people use. | — | — |
| Mobility | Leg swings | Front-to-back and side-to-side. What to hold on to, how far to swing, and how many before it stops doing anything. | Something to hold on to | — |
| Mobility | 90/90 hip switches | Seated, rotating between the two 90/90 positions. Internal and external rotation, and where to stop rather than force it. | — | — |
| Mobility | Rocking frog stretch | Knees wide, rocking back and forward instead of holding still. How wide to set up and where the limit is. | — | — |
| Stretches | Head-to-knee forward bend | Seated with one leg out, folding over it. Where the fold should come from, and what to do when the hamstring locks up early. | — | — |
| Stretches | Lizard stretch | Deep lunge with the hands inside the front foot, plus the shallower versions to work back from. | — | — |
| Stretches | Standing quad stretch | Heel towards the backside, standing. Keeping the hips square and the knee under you rather than drifting behind. | — | — |
| Stretches | Reclined figure-4 stretch | On your back, ankle across the opposite thigh. Where to pull from, and what to change if the hip pinches instead of stretching. | — | — |

### ⚠️ One to confirm

**Single-leg hip flexor hold** — there are a few different movements that go by
roughly this name (a supine knee-hold, a standing march hold, the ATG-style
banded raise). I've kept your wording and written a deliberately vague blurb
rather than guess at the wrong one. Tell me which you mean and I'll fix the title
and blurb.

### Resistance bands

Five movements can use one, and only **banded lateral walk** requires it. The
others — squat, glute bridge, single-leg glute bridge, single-leg hip flexor hold
— say "(optional)". Every one of them is tagged `band`, so searching "band" pulls
up the full set.

### How to fill it in

Everything above lives in one file, `lib/videos.ts`, with instructions at the
top. Per movement you need: a title, a blurb, a category, the YouTube or Vimeo
link, and a handful of **tags**. Tags never appear on the page but are searched —
so put the words an athlete would actually type in there, including ones you'd
never write in a title ("rfess", "groin", "no gym", "fueling" spelled the
American way). That's what makes the search feel like it reads your mind.

Two things worth knowing:

- **A movement's URL is permanent once you've sent it.** The slug in
  `/videos/<slug>` is what an athlete has in their messages; changing it breaks
  their link.
- **Runtimes are left blank on purpose.** They'll be filled in with the real
  ones — a card just doesn't show a duration until then.

## 14 · Group coaching waitlist page (`/waitlist`)

A standalone landing page whose only job is getting an email address onto the
waitlist — the link to put in your Instagram bio or a post. **Built 24 Aug 2026,
not pushed live yet.**

It's deliberately not the homepage: no navigation, no section index, nothing to
click except the email field until the footer. The offer, the field and the Join
button all sit above the fold on a laptop and on a phone.

It signs people up to **the same beehiiv list, with the same tag**
(`group-coaching-waitlist`) as the homepage form — so the draw is still one list,
not two. How many people arrive via this page is measured in Vercel Analytics
instead.

### Header

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Left | The logo (links to the homepage) |
| Right | Group coaching |

### The offer

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Eyebrow 🔒 | Waitlist · Opens end of September |

> ▸ **Headline** — three lines; the tape sits on "coached free." and cannot wrap.
> 5 people get **coached free.** Forever.

> ▸ **Body** 🔒
> Group coaching opens at the end of September. Five places are free — drawn at random from this waitlist, and free for as long as those five athletes want them. Everyone else pays €50/mo.

**Signup box** (the first thing on the page you can interact with):

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Heading | Join the waitlist |
| First name placeholder | First name |
| Experience level placeholder | Experience level |
| Experience level options | Beginner · Average · Experienced · Professional |
| Field placeholder | Enter your email |
| Button (red) | Join |
| Note under the field | Your name, roughly where you're at, and an email — that's the whole signup. No payment details, no commitment — unsubscribe whenever you like. |
| Success message | You're in — check your inbox |
| Success note 🔒 | You're on the list. The draw happens when the group opens at the end of September — I'll email you either way, and nothing before then. |

**The 05 panel** (right-hand side, big outlined numeral):

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Figure 🔒 | 05 |
| Label 🔒 | Free places, drawn at random |
| Line under it 🔒 | Free means free. Those five never pay for group coaching, for as long as they stay. |

### What you're joining — three columns

| ▸ Figure | ▸ Title | ▸ Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | Free forever 🔒 | The five drawn places never pay. Not a free trial, not a discounted first month — free for as long as you stay in the group. |
| 05 | Drawn at random 🔒 | Not the first five to sign up. Everyone on the waitlist when the group opens has the same chance, so joining now and joining tonight are worth exactly the same. |
| Sept | Opens end of September 🔒 | That's when the group starts and the draw happens. If you're not one of the five, it's €50/mo and you can walk away — nothing is owed for being on a list. |

These three are the whole pitch: **what free means, how you get it, and when.**
"Free forever" is said in the headline, in the panel and again here, because
"free" next to a monthly price is read as a trial unless you rule it out.

### What the coaching is

> ▸ **Headline** — the red emphasis sits on "at the same time."
> A few people training for the same kind of thing, **at the same time.**

> ▸ **Body**
> The same approach as my 1:1 work — training built around your job, your family and the week you actually have — with a few other runners doing it alongside you. Training for something long is a lot of solitary hours, and having other people inside the same week changes that.

The three "how the groups are built" rows that used to sit here have moved into
"Who you're in it with" below, where they're said once with the group size
attached, instead of twice in vaguer form.

### How it works

> ▸ **Headline** — red emphasis on the second sentence.
> Written for you. **Not for everyone.**

> ▸ **Body**
> The plan is the core of it — yours, written by me, changed when your life changes. The group is what gets you through the weeks it's hard.

**01 — the plan, in its own panel.** It sits above the row of three rather than
inside it, because it's the part people are actually buying; a fourth cell in a
row of equals reads as one feature among several.

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Title | A training plan, written for you |
| Body | Every session in it is written by me, for you. Not generated, not a template with your name typed into it, not last year's plan for somebody else. And it gets rewritten as you go — when your week changes, the plan changes. |
| Pull line (red rule) | And a video for every movement in it — each exercise your plan names, filmed being done properly, so you're never guessing at a name you haven't seen before. |

"Not generated" is doing the no-AI work without saying "AI", which would date the
page and sound defensive. Change it if you'd rather say it outright.

**Then the three columns:**

| ▸ No. | ▸ Title | ▸ Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 02 | A live group call, every week | The whole group on a call, once a week — the week behind you and the week ahead. Questions get answered in front of everyone, because the answer to yours is usually the answer to someone else's. |
| 03 | Me on WhatsApp, directly | The same number my 1:1 athletes text. A question about tomorrow's session on a Tuesday night doesn't have to sit until the next call. |
| 04 | A private channel for the group | A space that's only the group — where the runs get posted and the questions get asked between calls. A lot of what makes a group work happens here rather than on the call. |

⚠️ **The video line promises the library that isn't filmed.** `/videos` holds 21
movements and none of them have a clip yet; the page is `noindex` and 404s in
production. This line says every movement in a plan has one. It's true by the
end of September or it isn't — worth knowing that this page now depends on that
filming getting done.

⚠️ **"The same number my 1:1 athletes text"** is my wording for what you
described as direct WhatsApp access. If group athletes get a different number, a
shared thread, or slower response times than 1:1, that line has to change — it
currently promises parity with the €200/mo offer.

### Who you're in it with

> ▸ **Headline** — the second sentence is red.
> Close enough to relate to. **Far enough apart to pull you along.**

> ▸ **Body**
> Groups are built rather than filled. Around five runners, put together so the conversation is actually about you — alike enough in level and in life that you recognise each other's week, far enough apart that there's always someone a little further down the road.

| ▸ Row | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Around five of you | Small enough that I know what your week looks like, and that everyone in the group knows your name. |
| Matched on purpose | Grouped with runners whose goals and constraints look like yours, so the conversation is actually about you. |
| Mixed on level | Deliberately not all at the same standard. Close enough to relate to, far enough apart to pull each other along — and far enough that some weeks you're the one doing the pulling. |

⚠️ **Two fives on one page.** Five free places are drawn at random, and a group
holds around five people. A reader can join those up and conclude the first group
is entirely free, or that there's only one group. Nothing on the page says which,
because you haven't told me. Worth a line if the answer is simple.

### "Who's coaching" callout

A bordered card inside the black section — photo on the left, then:

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Eyebrow | Who's coaching |
| Name | Jonathan Fors |
| Credential line (red) 🔒 | UESCA-certified · Ultra-endurance running coach |
| Photo | `coach-trail` — the same shot as the homepage's "approach" section |

> ▸ **Body** 🔒
> I coach runners training for a first ultra, or a next hundred-miler — most of them with jobs, families and not enough hours in the week. In August 2026 I ran the coastline of Portugal, 744 km in 10 days, for men's mental health. Two years earlier the same route stopped me at 480 km, which is the more useful half of the experience.

> ▸ **Pull line** — set off by a red rule, because it's the most persuasive
> sentence on the page.
> I'm building this practice now, which is why five of these places are free. I'd rather fill the first group with people who want to be in it than with people who could afford it.

This was a plain grey paragraph until 24 Aug 2026. A reader about to hand over an
email wants to see who's asking, and a face does that faster than prose can —
hence the card and the photo.

⚠️ **Check the pull line.** Giving a reason the places are free is what makes the
offer read as real rather than as a gimmick — but it is you telling people you're
new, the same call as the missing-testimonials line on the homepage. Delete it and
nothing else breaks. Same for the 480 km sentence: it's honest and it's already on
the homepage, but it's your first attempt you're volunteering.

### The field again, at the bottom

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Headline | Get in the **draw.** |
| Body 🔒 | Five free places, drawn when the group opens at the end of September. Signing up early is no advantage — it just puts you in the draw. |
| First name placeholder | First name |
| Experience level placeholder | Experience level |
| Experience level options | Beginner · Average · Experienced · Professional |
| Field placeholder | Enter your email |
| Button (red) | Join the waitlist |
| Success note 🔒 | You're on the list — I'll email you when the group opens at the end of September. |

### The sticky bar

A slim bar pinned to the bottom of the screen. It carries a button back to the
form rather than a copy of the form itself — the signup asks three questions
now, and a bar deep enough to hold them would cover a third of a phone screen.
The button scrolls to the form in the hero and puts the cursor in the first
field. The label is shortened on a phone, where there's no room for the full
sentence beside the button.

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Label (phone) | 5 free places, drawn at random |
| Label (wider screens) 🔒 | 5 places free forever, drawn at random when the group opens at the end of September. |
| Button (red) | Join the waitlist |

It stays out of the way rather than following you down the page: it's down
whenever one of the page's own signup forms is on screen — so it never sits
under the field in the hero, and never covers the one at the bottom — and it
retires for good the moment a signup lands, from either form.

### Footer

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Left | Don't want to wait? **1:1 coaching is open now.** (links to the homepage) |
| Right | Email · Instagram |

The 1:1 link is down here on purpose. It's the answer for someone who read the
whole page and doesn't want to wait until September — put it any higher and it
competes with the one thing this page is for.

### Search / share

| ▸ Field | Current text |

| Browser tab title | Group coaching waitlist — Ultra Endurant |

## 15 · Shuffle Club newsletter page (`/newsletter`)

A standalone landing page with **one action on it: subscribe.** Same job as
`/waitlist` — the link to put in a bio, an Instagram post, or the foot of an
edition, where the homepage anchor buries the signup under three other sections.

Deliberately **no nav and no second offer.** Coaching isn't sold here at all:
every other link is a way to leave without subscribing, so the only ones on the
page are the wordmark (back to the homepage) and the footer's email/Instagram.
The email field is the first interactive thing on the page, and appears twice —
once in the hero, once at the bottom.

Both fields post the same `utm_medium` as the homepage block (`newsletter`), so
all subscribers land on one beehiiv list. Traffic to this page is told apart in
Vercel Analytics by route.

### Header

### The offer

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Eyebrow | Shuffle Club · Tuesdays, Fridays, Sundays |

The Shuffle Club logo sits above the headline — the dark-background version, red
type with the slashes and "CLUB" in off-white.

> ▸ **Headline** — "Free forever." is set in the red tape. Neither line can wrap:
> both are sized to hold one line on the narrowest phone.
> Three editions a week.
> **Free forever.**

> ▸ **Body**
> One subject a week, from three sides: what the research actually says, what I think about it after running on it, and whatever you send back. No fee, and nothing to buy at the end of it.

### The signup box (hero)

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Box heading | Subscribe |

### The number, beside the form

### Your week — three columns

| --- | --- |
| Section label | Your week |

> ▸ **Headline** — "three times." is red.
> The same subject, **three times.**

> ▸ **Body**
> Knees one week, heat the next. Tuesday explains it, Friday argues with it, Sunday answers what you asked about it.

| ▸ Day 🔒 | ▸ Title | ▸ Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tuesday | The science | One idea from the research, explained properly — the mechanism, not just the takeaway. Grounded in the coaching course material rather than whatever crossed my feed that week. |
| Friday | My take | The same subject from the road: what I actually do about it, and why. Marked as opinion, so you always know which half you're reading. |
| Sunday | Your questions | A real question from a subscriber, answered in full. Reply to any edition and yours goes in the pile. |

⚠️ **One to confirm:** Sunday says *"Reply to any edition and yours goes in the
pile."* That's an invitation to email you, and the style guide already says a
Sunday edition needs a real question from the inbox. Cut the line if you'd rather
not solicit them yet.

### Written by a coach

> ▸ **Headline** — "Not by a feed." is red.
> Written by a coach. **Not by a feed.**

> ▸ **Body**
> Tuesday's science comes out of the coaching course material I certified on, with the studies behind it named. Friday is my own opinion and it says so — you shouldn't have to guess which of the two you're reading. Every term gets explained the first time it turns up, because a newsletter you have to look things up to follow isn't worth the three minutes.

### "Who's writing it" callout

Same shape as the one on `/waitlist`: the photo, the name, then the paragraph.
A reader deciding whether to hand over an address wants to see who's asking.

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Label | Who's writing it |
| Name | Jonathan Fors |
| Line under the name 🔒 | UESCA-certified · Ultra-endurance running coach |

> ▸ **Paragraph** — the numbers are 🔒.
> I coach runners training for a first ultra, or a next hundred-miler — most of them with jobs, families and not enough hours in the week. In August 2026 I ran the coastline of Portugal, 744 km in 10 days, for men's mental health. Two years earlier the same route stopped me at 480 km, which is the more useful half of the experience — and a fair amount of what ends up in here.

### What you're signing up for — three columns

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Section label | What you're signing up for |

| ▸ Figure | ▸ Title | ▸ Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | Free forever | No paid tier, no course at the end of it, nothing held back for people who pay. The newsletter is the whole thing. |
| 03 | Three a week, not three a year | Tuesday, Friday and Sunday. Each one is a few minutes on a phone — short enough to actually read, long enough to be worth reading. |
| 01 | One subject a week | All three editions take the same theme from a different side, so a week adds up to something instead of arriving as three unrelated tips. |

### The field again, at the bottom

> ▸ **Headline** — "Tuesday." is set in the red tape.

No coaching link down here, unlike `/waitlist`. That page has a real second
answer for someone who won't wait until September; this one doesn't — there's
one action on it and the newsletter is free, so a €200/mo offer in the footer
would only be an interruption.

### 01 · Who we are — `#who-we-are`

The site you're reading is **ultraendurant.com**, the coaching practice of Jonathan Fors, trading as **Ultra Endurant**. The company behind it — and the data controller responsible for the personal data described here — is **Jon Corp OÜ**, registered at Sepapaja tn 6, 15551 Tallinn, Estonia.

"We" and "us" below mean that company. "I" means Jonathan, because most of what follows is one person reading your email and writing your training plan. For anything about your data, write to jonathan@ultraendurant.com — it reaches him directly, and there's no separate privacy desk to route it through.

### 02 · What this policy covers — `#what-this-covers`

This policy covers everything we run:

- The website at **ultraendurant.com**, including the group coaching waitlist and the Shuffle Club newsletter pages.
- The Shuffle Club newsletter itself.
- The intro call booking page and the athlete intake form.
- Coaching — one-to-one and group — including the messages, calls and training data that come with it.

It does not cover other people's sites we link to. Instagram, LinkedIn and anywhere else you might follow along are governed by their own policies.

### 03 · What we collect, and why — `#what-we-collect`

Grouped by what you did, because that's how it actually arrives. Nothing here is collected speculatively — if a field isn't on a form, we don't have it.

- **Reading the site** — Page views, the page you came from, and rough location by country — collected by Vercel Web Analytics, which sets no cookies and doesn't identify you. Separately, the Meta Pixel records the pages you visit along with your IP address and browser, and sets a cookie. See §4.
- **Subscribing to the newsletter** — Your email address, and nothing else — that's the whole form. We also record which page you signed up from, so we can tell the newsletter apart from the waitlist.
- **Joining the group waitlist** — Your email address, your first name and your running experience level. The name is so a message doesn't open "Hi there"; the level is so groups can be matched by ability, which is the point of the waitlist. If you refer someone, we also record that a referral came from you, so the extra entry in the draw can be credited.
- **Booking an intro call** — Your name, email address, the slot you chose and anything you type into the booking form. Since September 2026 this is handled by the Ultra Endurant App rather than a third-party scheduler, so the booking goes to Jon Corp OÜ directly and it is Jon Corp OÜ that creates the calendar entry.
- **The athlete intake form** — Your running history, current training, goals, past injuries and any health information you choose to share. This is the most sensitive thing we hold, and it exists for one reason: a coach who doesn't know about your knee will write you a plan that hurts it. The form is hosted by Notion.
- **Being coached** — WhatsApp messages, notes from our calls, the training you log, how sessions went, and whatever you tell me about sleep, stress, work and injury along the way. Payment records too — though card details are handled by the payment provider and never reach us.
- **The chat widget** — The first name and email address you give it, and whatever you then write. It is the Ultra Endurant App's own chat, so the conversation goes to Jon Corp OÜ directly rather than to an outside support tool.
- **Emailing us** — Whatever's in the email, kept in the mailbox like any other correspondence.

> Some of this is **health information** — injuries, conditions, medication, how your body is holding up. Under the GDPR that's a special category of data, and we only hold it because you chose to tell us and gave explicit consent by sending it. You can withdraw that consent at any time, though it's worth saying plainly: without it, coaching you safely is guesswork.

### 04 · Cookies and tracking — `#cookies`

**What sets a cookie**

- **The Meta Pixel.** It loads on every page and reports your visit to Meta, along with your IP address, browser and the page you're on. It also reports when someone completes a signup, so we can tell whether an advert led to one. It sets cookies — _fbp and friends — which Meta can use to link your visit here to your Facebook or Instagram account.
- **The Ultra Endurant App.** The chat widget in the corner loads on every page and sets a cookie there to tell one browser from another. The booking popup is the same app, but it loads nothing until you open it. Both are run by Jon Corp OÜ — the same company behind this site — rather than by an outside scheduling or support service.
- **YouTube**, on the training video pages, and only when you press play. The embeds use the no-cookie domain, so simply loading the page sends nothing.

**What doesn't**

Vercel Web Analytics — the thing that tells us a page was read — sets no cookies and stores no identifiers. Our own fonts are served from this domain, so nothing goes to Google to render the page.

> **There is currently no cookie banner on this site.** The Meta Pixel therefore loads as soon as a page does, before you've been asked. We'd rather say so here than let a policy imply a consent step that doesn't exist. Until that changes, the controls below are how to stop it.

**How to refuse it**

- Block third-party cookies in your browser, or use its tracking protection — Safari, Firefox and Brave block the pixel by default.
- Turn off off-Facebook activity and ad personalisation in your Meta account settings.
- Use any content blocker. Nothing on this site needs the pixel to work — every page, form and booking link works fine without it.

### 05 · Why we're allowed to hold it — `#legal-bases`

The GDPR needs a legal basis for each use. Ours, in plain terms:

- **Consent** — The newsletter, the waitlist, and the Meta Pixel's advertising use. You gave it by typing your address in or by browsing with tracking allowed, and you can take it back at any time — there's an unsubscribe link at the foot of every email.
- **Explicit consent** — Health and injury information, under Article 9(2)(a). You choose what to tell us.
- **Performing a contract** — Everything needed to actually coach you: your plan, your training data, our messages, your invoices.
- **Legitimate interests** — Site analytics, keeping the site secure, and keeping records of who we've worked with. We've weighed these against your privacy; they involve no profiling and no decisions about you.
- **Legal obligation** — Accounting records, which Estonian law requires us to keep for a set period whatever anyone would prefer.

### 06 · Who else sees it — `#who-sees-it`

We don't sell your data and we don't trade lists. We do use other companies to run the practice, and they process data on our instructions:

- **beehiiv** — United States. Runs the newsletter and both signup lists — holds your email address, first name and experience level, and the referral tracking.
- **Vercel** — United States, serving from Europe. Hosts the site and provides the cookieless analytics; server logs pass through it.
- **Meta** — Ireland and the United States. The pixel described in §4, and WhatsApp, which is how coaching conversations happen.
- **Notion** — United States. Hosts the athlete intake form and its answers.
- **Google** — United States. YouTube hosts the training videos, and Google Workspace the mailbox and calendar.
- **Accountants and advisers** — Estonia. Invoices and payment records, where the law or a genuine dispute requires it.

If a court or a regulator legitimately requires us to hand something over, we will. Otherwise your data stays where it is.

### 07 · Sending data outside Europe — `#transfers`

Several of the companies above are based in the United States, so some of your data leaves the European Economic Area. Where it does, the transfer relies on the European Commission's standard contractual clauses, or on the EU–US Data Privacy Framework where the company is certified under it.

We're not going to pretend that's the same as your data never leaving Europe. It's the honest state of using ordinary tools to run a small coaching practice, and it's why the list above is short and why nothing sensitive goes into an advertising platform.

### 08 · How long we keep it — `#retention`

- **Newsletter** — Until you unsubscribe, and then a record that you did so — which is how we avoid adding you back.
- **Group waitlist** — Until the group programme has launched and the draw has been run, and for up to twelve months after that in case a place opens up. Ask to come off it sooner and you'll come off it sooner.
- **Intake forms** — Twelve months, if you don't go on to be coached. If you do, it becomes part of your coaching record.
- **Coaching records** — For as long as we're working together, and two years after that — coming back to running after a break is common, and your history is the most useful thing in the room when you do.
- **Invoices and accounts** — Seven years, as Estonian accounting law requires. This one isn't ours to shorten.
- **Analytics and pixel data** — Held by Vercel and Meta on their own schedules — around two years in Meta's case.

### 09 · Your rights — `#your-rights`

Under the GDPR you can ask us to do all of the following, and we won't make it difficult:

- **See it.** A copy of everything we hold about you.
- **Correct it.** If something's wrong, we'll fix it.
- **Delete it.** Bearing in mind we can't delete an invoice the tax authority requires us to keep.
- **Take it with you.** Your data in a portable format, including your training history.
- **Restrict or object.** Including objecting to anything we do on the basis of legitimate interests.
- **Withdraw consent.** At any time, without giving a reason. It doesn't undo what was done while consent was in place.

Email jonathan@ultraendurant.com and say what you want. We'll answer within a month, and there's no charge. We may ask you to confirm you're you — which is a protection for you, not an obstacle.

If we get it wrong, you can complain to Andmekaitse Inspektsioon (the Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate), or to the data protection authority in the country where you live. We'd rather you told us first, but it's your call.

### 10 · Keeping it safe — `#security`

The site is served over HTTPS. Accounts that hold your data are protected with two-factor authentication and a password manager. The beehiiv API key that handles signups lives on the server and never reaches your browser. Access is limited to the people who need it, which in practice means Jonathan.

No system is perfect. If something happened that put your data at real risk, we'd tell you and the regulator rather than hope nobody noticed.

### 11 · Automated decisions — `#decisions`

We don't profile you and nothing about you is decided by a machine. Your training plan is written by a person — that's the offer, not a footnote.

The five free group coaching places are drawn **at random** from the waitlist. Nothing about you affects the outcome: not your experience level, not how early you signed up. Referring someone earns one extra entry, and that's the only thing that changes the odds.

### 12 · Children — `#children`

Coaching is for adults. The services here aren't intended for anyone under 18 and we don't knowingly collect their data. If you think a child has signed up, tell us at jonathan@ultraendurant.com and we'll remove it.

### 13 · Changes to this policy — `#changes`

When this changes, the date at the top changes with it. If a change actually matters — a new company handling your data, a new use for it — we'll say so in the newsletter rather than quietly editing the page.

Questions about any of it: jonathan@ultraendurant.com. A real person reads that address.

page. **This section is generated from the live page**, so edit the text
here, tell me, and I'll apply it — but don't reformat the headings.

### Header

| ▸ Field | Current text |
| --- | --- |
| Eyebrow | Legal · Terms |
| Headline | Terms of service. |
| Intro 1 | The terms for coaching, the group programme, the waitlist draw and the newsletter. Written in plain English, because terms nobody reads protect nobody. |
| Intro 2 | If you read one clause, read §5 — coaching is not medical care, and the difference matters more than anything else on this page. |
| Date line | Last updated 9 September 2026 |

### 01 · Who you're dealing with — `#who-you-deal-with`

Coaching, the newsletter and this website are provided by **Jon Corp OÜ**, registered at Sepapaja tn 6, 15551 Tallinn, Estonia, trading as Ultra Endurant. That company is who you contract with; Jonathan is who you'll actually talk to.

Contact for anything in these terms: jonathan@ultraendurant.com.

### 02 · Agreeing to these terms — `#agreeing`

By using this site, subscribing to the newsletter, joining the waitlist or starting coaching, you accept these terms. If you don't, the answer is simply not to use them — nothing here is buried in a checkbox.

They work alongside the privacy policy, which covers what happens to your data.

### 03 · Who can use it — `#who-can-use`

You need to be 18 or over. Coaching involves training decisions and a contract, and neither is something to do on a parent's behalf.

Coaching is delivered remotely and in English. It doesn't matter where you live, as long as we can find an hour that works for a call.

### 04 · What's on offer — `#what-is-on-offer`

- **Intro call** — A free 30-minute call, booked through the booking page. No obligation on either side, and no sales script. It exists so we can both decide whether this is worth doing.
- **1:1 coaching** — €200/mo, no minimum period. Sessions written for you rather than pulled from a template, a weekly call, extra calls when you need them, and access to me on WhatsApp.
- **Group coaching** — €50/mo, launching end of September 2026. Around five athletes per group, each with a plan written personally for them, a weekly live group call, a private group channel, direct WhatsApp access, and a video for every movement in the plan. 5 places are free — see §10.
- **Shuffle Club** — The newsletter. Three editions a week, free, no paid tier. See §13.
- **The video library** — Training videos for the movements a plan names, shared with the athletes being coached. One clip per movement, and the link to a given movement is meant to stay valid.

Prices and what's included are as stated on this site at the time you start. If they change later, your arrangement carries on at the price you agreed — a price rise applies to new athletes, not to you mid-flow.

### 05 · Coaching is not medical care — `#not-medical-advice`

This is the most important clause on the page, so it's said straight. Jonathan is a **UESCA-certified running coach**. He is not a doctor, a physiotherapist, a dietitian or a psychologist, and nothing he provides is medical diagnosis, treatment or a substitute for professional healthcare.

- A training plan is coaching guidance, not a prescription. It's based on what you've told us and what we can see from your training — not on an examination.
- Anything said about nutrition, sleep, pain, fuelling or recovery is general endurance-coaching guidance, and applies to a healthy adult.
- Opinions in the newsletter are opinions, marked as such. The science editions cite their sources, and none of it is advice about your particular body.

> **Before you start, talk to a doctor** — especially if you have a heart condition, a chronic illness, an existing injury, are pregnant, are on medication, or have been away from training for a long time. If something hurts in a way that isn't ordinary training discomfort, stop and get it looked at by someone qualified to look at it. Nothing in a plan is worth doing through a real injury, and no session matters more than that.

In an emergency, call your local emergency number. We are not a medical service and cannot respond as one.

### 06 · Your part in it — `#your-part`

Coaching only works on accurate information, and the athlete is the only source of it. So:

- Tell us your real training history, injuries, conditions and medication — including the awkward parts. A plan built on a flattering version of your history is a plan built wrong.
- Tell us when something changes: an injury, an illness, a work crisis, a bad run of sleep. The plan is meant to move around your life, which it can only do if we know.
- Use your own judgement on the day. You decide whether to start a session, and you're the only one who can feel what your body is doing. Skipping a session because something feels wrong is a correct decision, not a failure.
- Keep your account details and any private group links to yourself.

### 07 · Risk, and what we're liable for — `#risk-and-liability`

Running long distances carries real risk — injury, illness, and worse in extreme conditions. You take part voluntarily and you accept that risk. Following a plan reduces some of it and eliminates none of it.

Within that, and to the extent the law allows:

- We're not liable for injury, illness or loss arising from training you chose to do, from a race result, or from following guidance in a way we didn't intend.
- We're not liable for indirect losses — lost race entries, travel costs, lost earnings, a missed goal.
- Where we are liable, our total liability is limited to the fees you paid us in the three months before the problem arose.

> Nothing above limits liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, for fraud, or for anything else the law does not allow us to exclude. If you're a consumer, your statutory rights come first and this clause does not touch them.

### 08 · Paying, and stopping — `#paying`

**Price and billing**

1:1 coaching is €200/mo; group coaching is €50/mo. Both are billed monthly in advance, by the method we agree when you start. Prices are in euro. Where VAT applies, it's included in the figure shown.

**No minimum period**

There isn't one, and there is no notice period. Tell us you're stopping and the arrangement ends at the end of the month you've paid for — you keep the coaching you've paid for until then. We don't refund part-months, and we don't hold anyone in a contract they've stopped wanting.

**Late payment**

If a payment fails we'll tell you and try again. If it stays unpaid, coaching pauses until it's sorted out. Nobody gets chased by a debt collector over a training plan.

### 09 · Changing your mind — `#withdrawal`

If you're a consumer in the EU, you have **14 days** from starting to withdraw from the contract without giving a reason. Email jonathan@ultraendurant.com and it's done — no form to fill in.

Two things worth knowing, because they're the parts people are usually surprised by. If you ask us to start coaching inside those 14 days and then withdraw, you pay a fair amount for what was actually delivered — a written plan and a call are real work. And if the service has been fully delivered within the 14 days at your express request, the right to withdraw is used up.

The newsletter and the waitlist cost nothing, so there's nothing to withdraw from: leave whenever you like.

### 10 · The group waitlist, and the draw — `#the-draw`

The group coaching waitlist is free to join and joining it isn't a place in a group — it's a place on the list, and an entry in the draw for the free places.

- **5 places are free.** Free for as long as the athlete stays in the group — not a free month, not a trial that converts. Everyone else pays €50/mo.
- **They're drawn at random.** Signing up early is deliberately no advantage, and neither is your experience level or anything else about you. There is no queue to be at the front of.
- **Refer one person and you get one extra entry** — two instead of one. That is the only way to change your odds, and it runs on beehiiv's referral tracking.
- We'll remove obvious duplicates, test addresses and anything that looks like an attempt to game the draw. Otherwise every entry is equal.
- The draw runs around the launch of the programme, end of September 2026. If that date moves, the draw moves with it — we'll say so rather than go quiet.

Groups are around five athletes, matched to have enough in common to relate to each other and enough difference in level to push each other. Who ends up in which group is our call, and it isn't a judgement of anyone.

Being on the waitlist is not a promise of a place, free or paid. If the programme doesn't launch, nobody is charged and everyone gets told.

### 11 · Inside a group — `#the-group`

A group only works if it's a place people can be honest in. So the rules are short and they're not negotiable:

- What's said in the group stays in the group. Don't repeat it, screenshot it, or take it elsewhere.
- Don't record calls, and don't share the call link or the private channel with anyone outside the group.
- Don't give each other medical advice. Share what happened to you; leave diagnosis to the professionals.
- Be decent. Nobody in a group is competing with anybody else in it.

We can remove someone from a group, with a refund of any unused paid time, if this stops being true. It has never happened and hopefully won't.

### 12 · Availability and response times — `#availability`

"Access to me on WhatsApp" means you can write whenever something comes up, not that someone is awake to answer. In practice you'll normally hear back the same day, and rarely more than a day later.

Occasionally I'm on a long run or somewhere without signal — in August 2026 that meant 744 km down the coast of Portugal over 10 days. When a stretch like that is coming, you'll know in advance and cover is arranged. Calls that get missed get rescheduled, not written off.

### 13 · The newsletter — `#newsletter`

Shuffle Club is free and it stays free — there is no paid tier and nothing sold at the end of an edition. Three editions a week: Tuesday the science, Friday my own take on it, Sunday reader questions.

Friday is opinion and says so. Tuesday cites its sources. Neither is advice about you specifically — see §5.

Unsubscribe from the link at the foot of any edition. If you send in a question, we may answer it in a Sunday edition without your name attached; say so and we won't use it at all. We may change the schedule or stop publishing, in which case we'll tell subscribers.

### 14 · Who owns what — `#ownership`

Your training plan is yours to use. Everything we made in order to give it to you — the videos, the newsletter, the words and design on this site, the methods behind a plan — stays ours.

- You get a personal licence to use your plan and the video library for your own training, for as long as you're being coached and after.
- Don't resell it, republish it, coach someone else off it, or feed it into a product or a training service.
- Video links are shared with you, not with the internet. Passing one to a training partner is fine; posting it isn't.
- Your own data — your history, your logs, what you write to us — stays yours. See the privacy policy.

If you're happy with the coaching and want to say so publicly, that's welcome. We'll only use your name, photo or words in anything of ours if you've said we can.

### 15 · Ending it — `#ending`

Either of us can stop, at any time, by saying so in writing. Yours ends at the end of the month you've paid for (see §8). We'd only end it early for non-payment, for abusive behaviour, or if continuing wouldn't be safe or honest — and in the last case we'd refund unused time.

When it ends, your current plan is yours to keep and use. Access to WhatsApp, the group channel, the calls and the video library stops. Ask within 30 days and we'll send you your training history in a form you can take elsewhere.

### 16 · Things outside our control — `#beyond-our-control`

We're not liable for failing to deliver something because of events genuinely beyond our control — illness, injury, a failure at one of the services we rely on, or a natural disaster. Where a disruption is more than brief, we'll make the time up or refund it.

### 17 · Changes to these terms — `#changes`

We may update these terms. The date at the top changes when we do. If a change materially affects coaching you're already receiving, we'll tell you directly before it applies to you — and you can stop, at no notice, if you don't accept it.

### 18 · Law, and disagreements — `#law`

These terms are governed by the law of Estonia, and the Estonian courts have jurisdiction. If you're a consumer, that doesn't take away the protections you have under the law of the country you live in, or your right to bring a claim there.

Before any of that: email jonathan@ultraendurant.com and tell us what's wrong. This is a one-person coaching practice, not a company with a complaints department, and almost anything is fixable by saying it out loud.

## What the rewrite changed

The brief was: human over sales, honesty over cool claims, lead with facts, dig
deeper with emotions. Concretely that meant five moves.

1. **First person, throughout.** The page used to describe a service ("Holistic
   coaching for ambitious runners…"). It now says what you do ("I coach runners
   training for a first ultra…"). Same facts, one person behind them.

2. **The failure leads the Portugal section.** 480 km and an immune system that gave
   out is the part of that story a runner can use. The 744 km is still there; it just
   isn't the opening line any more.

3. **Claims swapped for facts or opinions labelled as opinions.** Gone: "the standard
   I coach from", "programs are tailored, not off-the-shelf", "the premium option",
   "the easiest way in", "let's find your distance". Facts stayed exactly as they
   were — 744, 480, 10 days, €200, €50, 5 places, 11.1k, UESCA.

4. **Two things said out loud that a sales page would hide:** who you're *not* for
   (§2), and that there are no testimonials yet because the practice is new (§6b).
   Both are marked ⚠️ above — they're the two judgement calls in here.

5. **A stale contradiction fixed.** §5 used to say the cost "depends on you and your
   race" while §6 printed €200/mo two screens later.

### What I couldn't write, and you can

Two gaps where the page stops at facts because I don't have anything true to go
deeper with. A sentence from you on either would be the strongest thing on the site:

- **Why men's mental health.** The page states the run was for it. It never says why
  it's the cause you chose, which is the one place the page could go genuinely
  personal.
- **Why you started coaching.** Your UESCA profile says "my own love of going long."
  There's presumably more to it — what made you want to coach other people rather
  than just keep running.

Nothing about either was invented to fill the space.

## Notes

- **The signup fields are ours now**, not a beehiiv embed — so the placeholder,
  button label and confirmation line above are all editable copy. Submitting
  completes the signup on the page — no redirect — and swaps in the success
  message. The two forms are told apart in beehiiv by `utm_medium`:
  `group-coaching-waitlist` for the waitlist, `newsletter` for Shuffle Club.
  Verified working against the live beehiiv API on 18 Aug 2026. If beehiiv is
  ever unreachable the form quietly falls back to the old magic link instead of
  failing, so a signup is never lost.

- **Photos** — there are three, all shot on the Portugal run. Each has alt text, which
  is what screen readers and search engines see:

  | ▸ Where | ▸ Alt text | ▸ File |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Hero | Jonathan Fors running towards the camera along a coastal road, a lighthouse and his support truck behind him. | `2X6A5151` |
  | The approach | Jonathan Fors standing on a coastal path above a beach, the Atlantic behind him. | `2X6A5137` |
  | Portugal band | Jonathan Fors running a coastal path with the Atlantic behind him. | `2X6A5141` |

  Tell me if any of these describe the wrong thing. The source files live in
  `0. Coaching/Photos/`; the site copies are rotated upright, stripped of camera
  metadata and re-compressed, so swapping one means re-exporting rather than just
  dropping a new file in.
- **Voice check** before you rewrite anything: direct, grounded, understated. No hype,
  no exclamation marks, no "unlock your potential".
- **Prices and dates** are held in one file (`lib/site.ts`) so they can never disagree
  between sections. Change them here and I'll update that one place.
