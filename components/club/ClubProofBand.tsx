/**
 * The running record — Jonathan as an accomplished runner, not just a coach.
 *
 * This used to be the Portugal band alone. Portugal is still here and still
 * ends on the failed first attempt, because a record that only lists wins
 * invites the reader to discount all of it. But the run is now the last of
 * three credentials rather than the whole case: ITRA and Elite runner say he races at a
 * level, Portugal says he can suffer at one.
 *
 * ⚠️ The ITRA and MDS claims are unsourced — see `record` in lib/site.ts.
