/**
 * Terms of service.
 *
 * Prices, the group coaching terms and the draw rules are read from
 * `lib/site.ts` rather than typed here, so a price change in one place can't
 * leave the legal page contradicting the offer it governs.
 *
 * Three clauses carry real weight and were written rather than borrowed: §5
 * (coaching is not medical care), §7 (risk and liability) and §10 (the draw,
 * which has to say plainly that signing up early is no advantage — the whole
 * point of drawing at random).
 *
 * ⚠️ Open: no payment provider is named in §8, because none has been confirmed
 * — the clause says "the method we agree" instead. Confirm it and name it.
 *
 * Note `groupCoaching.launch` is already "opens end of September" — the month is in
 * the value, so it takes a bare year after it, not "of September 2026".
 *
 * The wording is mirrored in `COPY.md` §17.

          Either of us can stop, at any time, by saying so in writing. Yours
          ends at the end of the month you&apos;ve paid for (see §8). We&apos;d
          only end it early for non-payment, for abusive behaviour, or if
          continuing wouldn&apos;t be safe or honest — and in the last case
          we&apos;d refund unused time.
