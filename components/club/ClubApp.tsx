/**
 * The Ultra Endurant App — where the coaching actually happens.
 *
 * Every athlete uses it, 1:1 and group alike, so this sits before the offers
 * rather than inside one of them: it's the shape of the work, not a perk of a
 * tier. There is no screenshot and no launch date here on purpose — nothing
 * about the app's build has been stated, so this describes what it does for an
 * athlete and stops there.
 *
 * The AI stance gets the one red block in the section. It's the only claim on
 * the page that's an argument rather than a feature, and burying it in the
 * list would sell it as a capability instead of the limit it is.
