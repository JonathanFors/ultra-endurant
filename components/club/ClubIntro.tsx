/**
 * The introduction — Jonathan in the first person, once, at length.
 *
 * This carries the `#approach` anchor the nav has always pointed at. It
 * replaces the old two-column "The approach" section, whose holistic-health
 * panel is now a hero key and whose "who this is for" list grew into its own
 * section. What's left is the part that only works in his own voice, so it's
 * set as one long statement with a byline rather than broken into panels —
 * the format is the point: a person talking, not a company describing itself.

                Most plans start with the schedule and expect your life to bend
                around it. I start at the other end. Your work, your family, the
                worries you&apos;re already carrying — all of it changes how
                your body handles training, so all of it gets counted before a
                single session is written. Rest, and everything else off the
                road, is part of the work rather than a gap in it.
