 * requests from a page anyway.
 *
 * Both forms (newsletter and group waitlist) send a first name, which is
 * written to beehiiv's First Name custom field. The group waitlist also sends
 * running experience.
 *
 * A hidden honeypot field is checked: automated bots that fill in the trap
 * are quietly accepted with a 200 OK without forwarding anything to beehiiv.
