 * offer did not change with it: one coach, writing every plan himself. So the
 * two are not interchangeable in copy, and swapping one for the other is a
 * meaning change, not a find-and-replace:
 *
 * - `name` is the business — tab titles, the wordmark, the copyright line, the
 *   trading name on the legal pages, anything a company would sign.
 * - `coach` is the human — photo captions, the JSON-LD `Person`, a byline, and
 *   anywhere the copy speaks about who an athlete actually works with.
 *
 * `attribution` is the line that keeps the first from swallowing the second.
